        <h2>Cornflake Crusted Chicken Tenders</h2>
        <p>These perfectly crispy cornflake chicken tenders baked to perfection are simply life changing! Truly crunchy, beautifully golden, and easy to make chicken tenders for busy weeknights.</p>
        <p>These cornflake chicken tenders are my newest finger food obsession.

            We serve them with an irresistible honey mustard sauce, some type of green like roasted broccoli or salad and fries or mac and cheese. It’s like an adult version of a kids meal and I’m all about it!
            
            These baked chicken tenders can also be served as an appetizer too. Set out a couple different dipping sauces and everyone will be happy!</p>

            <h3>Step by Step Directions</h3>
                <ol>
                    <li>Preheat the oven to 450</li>
                    <li>Line baking sheet with the foil and place a rack on top of the baking sheet. Spray with non-stick spray</li>
                    <li>Crush cornflakes in a large baggie, or use a <strong>food processor</strong> until crumbly</li>
                    <li>Set up a dredging station: you'll need 3 shallow dishes. Combine the flour and seasonings in the first dish, eggs and water in the second and cornflakes in the third</li>
                    <li>Place the chicken tender in the flour first, flipping from side to side to coat. Then place in the egg wash, then place in the cornflakes. Gently press cornflakes onto chicken to adhere</li>
                    <li>Transfer chicken to prepared baking sheet and repeat with remaining chicken</li>
                    <li>Bake and serve immediately with honey mustard dipping sauce or any sauce of your choice</li>
                </ol>  
            <h3>Tips and Variations</h3>      
                <ul>
                    <li>Pat the chicken tenders dry with a paper towel. If there is too much moisture it can make the flour soggy!</li>
                    <li>When dredging the Chicken, use <strong>tongs</strong> instead of your hands for a cleaner process.</li>
                    <li>Serve with different sauces like ranch, bleu cheese, bbq sauce or your favorite buffalo sauce</li>
                    <li>Use pank breadcrumbs if you don't have any cornflakes</li>
                    <li>Add different seasonings to the flour if you prefer.</li>
                    <li>Remove the white tendon attatched to the chicken tenderloin if youd like.</li>
