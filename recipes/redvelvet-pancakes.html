            <h2>Ingredients</h2>
            <h3>Cream Cheese Topping</h3>
                <ul>

                    <li>1/4 cup butter, softened</li>
                    <li>3 tablespoons milk</li>
                    <li>2 cups powdered sugar</li>
                </ul>

            <h3>Pancakes</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>2 cups Original Bisquick mix</li>
                <li>1 tablespoon granulated sugar</li>
                <li>1 tablespoon unsweetened baking cacoa</li>
                <li>1 cup milk</li>
                <li>1 to 1 1/2 teaspoons red paste food color</li>
                <li>2 eggs</li>
                <li>(optional)powdered sugar</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Step by Step Directions</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>In medium bowl, beat cream cheese, butter and 3 tablespoons milk with electric mixer on low speed until smooth. Gradually beat in 2 cups powdered sugar, 1 cup at a time, on low speed until topping is smooth. Cover; set aside.</li>
                <li>In large bowl, stir all pancake ingredients except powdered sugar with wire whisk until well blended. Heat griddle or skillet over medium-high heat (375Â°F). (To test griddle, sprinkle with a few drops of water. If bubbles jump around, heat is just right.) Brush with vegetable oil if necessary or spray with cooking spray before heating.</li>
                <li>
                    For each pancake, pour slightly less than 1/4 cup batter onto hot griddle. Cook 2 to 3 minutes or until bubbles form on top and edges are dry. Turn; cook other side until golden brown.</li>
                <li>Spoon cream cheese topping into resealable food-storage plastic bag; seal bag. Cut off tiny corner of bag; squeeze bag to drizzle topping over pancakes. Sprinkle with powdered sugar.</li>
